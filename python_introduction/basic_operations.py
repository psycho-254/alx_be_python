# Objective: To practice basic arithmetic operations in Python by performing predefined calculations.

# Task Description:

# You are required to complete a Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations with two predefined numbers. 
# The script should do the following:

# Assign specific values to two variables, number1 and number2.
# Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers.
# Print the results of these operations in a human-readable format.
# Instructions:

# Create a file named basic_operations.py.
# In this file, you will define two variables: number1 and number2, with the values 10 and 5, respectively.
# You do not need to write any functions or import any modules.
# Calculate the sum, difference (by subtracting number2 from number1), and product of number1 and number2.
# Print the results of each operation in the format: [operation] of [number1] and [number2] is [result].
# Expected Output:

# When executed, your script should print the following (assuming number1 = 10 and number2 = 5):

# How to execute

# python3 basic_operations.py
# Here is the outcome

# Addition of 10 and 5 is 15
# Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5
# Multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50

## Define the two variables with specific 

number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Perform the arithmetic operations

# perform addition operation of number1 and number2
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {number1 + number2}")

# perform subtraction operation: subtract number2 from number1
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {number1 - number2}")

# perform multiplication operation of number1 and number2
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {number1 * number2}")
